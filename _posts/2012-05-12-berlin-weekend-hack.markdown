Here’s a quick video of the protoype I hacked together over a weekend last month while in Berlin.

It’s a social marketplace app for browsing design products with a fun browsing & feedback interface – swipe left for next, up to discard item, down to ‘favorite’. There’s also a product upload/download feature to a Parse.com back end, which has its limitations but is great for a quick hack.

First line of code to project demo/pitch was a mere 36 hours, with a bit of commute + sleep in between :)
