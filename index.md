title: Coaching Entrepreneurs to Find More Ease and Joy in Life
---


I help entrepreneurs suffering from stress, burnout, and crises of meaning find more ease, flow and connection.

My approach uses nervous system regulation, emotional embodiment, and mindfulness to help you get out of your own way and grow beyond unhelpful patterns.

We'll work together to help you come into better relationship with your emotions and the wisdom of your body, so you can feel greater trust, safety and belonging going forward.

I bring my life experience as a repeat founder, lifelong expat and thousands of hours in meditation and professional therapeutic trainings, including:

* Somatic Experiencing
* Integral Somatic Psychology
* Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy
