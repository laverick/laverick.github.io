Hi, my name is Dustin Laverick. 

I'm a software developer and entrepreneur.

I used to make video games for big companies. These days I do consulting on technology and business strategy, implementation of mobile and server tech, and work on my own ideas.

If you need help with a project or just want to have a chat please get in touch.
